                        <p>Panta Ilish is a traditional food that almost every Bangladeshi eats at the Pohela Boishakh Festival. It’s the most popular food in Bangladesh. We love this dish as it is a great symbol and celebration of our culture and tradition. It’s a platter of leftover rice soaked in water and served with fried hilsa, achar, and dal. People eat Panta Ilish in the morning of Pohela Boishakh and then take part in cultural programs. Another fish, American shad, tastes like hilsa, so you can buy that and have yourself some Bengali pleasure. </p>

                        <h1 className='text-2xl font-bold'>Kacchi Biryani</h1>
                        <p>Kacchi Biryani is one of Bangladeshi people’s most loved foods. It is so loved, it is served at most festivals and special occasions, such as weddings, picnics, etc. I love this dish. The most popular biryani in Bangladesh is Dhaka Kacchi Biryani. You will always find the Dhaka street biryani stall crowded because of the huge demand for this food. The main ingredients are rice and marinated meat cooked in lots of spices, giving it its special taste.</p>

                        <p>Khichuri is a dish made of rice and lentils (dal). Vuna Khichuri (roasted) is cooked with different ingredients and spices from normal Khichuri. It’s served with roasted meat and pickle. It’s one of the tastiest and best loved foods in Bangladesh. Seasoned with a dash of turmeric and salt and topped with ghee, Khuchuri makes an ideal lunch or dinner. </p>

                        <p>Almost every restaurant in Bangladesh serves this dish, and more than 50,000 grilled chickens are sold every day throughout the country. There are different ways of grilling chicken and there are many variations of spices that are used. Many restaurants roast chickens in a glass oven placed outside to entice people in to eat. It’s a very successful strategy. </p>

                        <p>Haleem is a popular stew made with meat—usually beef or mutton—lentils, barley, and spices. It is sold on street stalls and in bazaars (markets) as a snack, and making haleem involves a lengthy and complex process. It can be served with mint, lemon juice, coriander leaves, fried onions, ginger root, and green chilies. Haleem is a high-calorie dish, providing protein from the meat and fiber and carbohydrates from the combinations of grains and pulses. </p>
