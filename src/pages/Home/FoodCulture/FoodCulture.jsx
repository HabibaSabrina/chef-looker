            <p className='my-5 leading-7'>Bangladesh is a small country in South Asia, but with some great cuisine and a rich culture. Some food items are popular across entire Bangladesh, while some are regional favorites. In Rajshahi and Rangpur areas, the use of freshwater fish is huge. This region is also famous for its sweets. The town of Comilla is famous for its food culture, most notably the Tehari or Biryani, a rice-based dish. Saltwater fish are commonly found in Barisal and Khulna regions, which are also famous for their heavy use of the spice Piper chaba. The staples of Bangladeshi cuisine are rice and, to a lesser extent, roti (whole wheat flatbread). These are generally consumed with vegetable, poultry, beef, fish, goat, and mutton curries. Ducks, koel, and pigeons are also eaten in the rural areas. This country also has to offer a host of vegetables, such as a variety of gourds, roots and tubers, leafy green vegetables, succulent stalks, citrons and limes, green and purple eggplants, okra, red onions, banana tree stems and flowers, etc.</p>
